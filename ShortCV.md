Geo4LibCamp is an annual unconference hosted at Stanford University, meant to foster collaboration, learning and progress on spatial data services and support in libraries. The meeting is accompanied by an annual working meeting of the Geoblacklight developer community.

### IIIF + Maps Community
##### Role: Co-founder/Co-Chair
https://iiif.io/community/groups/maps/  
This group works on defining best practice in associating geographic data with IIIF materials. This includes IIIF recipes but also more in depth work to align efforts to link IIIF maps to geospatial systems. The group recently succeeded bringing **navPlace**, and extension for associating spatial data with IIIF digital object, to approval.
