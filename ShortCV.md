### Making Pastoralists Count
https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.18-1009  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0VBNW87ArI  

Currently funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:  
https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/geospatial-methodology-reach-mobile-populations

The Stanford Geospatial Center is now working with School of Medicine researcher, Hannah Binzen Wild, to incorporate lessons learned in the field and to automate the use of high-cadence satellite imagery, machine learning in identifying the locations of active nomadic pastoralist settlements. Remote in the extreme, widely dispersed and highly mobile, the difficulty of conducting complete settlement surveys has resulted in the Nyangatom, and populations like them, being missed by most public health needs assessments in the past. Wild's aim is to perform the first randomized surveys on these types of populations in order to provide baseline data for the evaluation of future public health interventions.

[Improving Nighttime Access to Care and Treatment (Part 2) (INACT2)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03943654)

Part of the Improving Nighttime Access to Care and Treatment (INACT) Project.

Consulting spatial data scientist and field data specialist. Designed and implemented survey frameworks for highly-dispersed, unaddressed households in Leogane and Gressier communnes, Haiti.



### Outbreak Responder  

The app:  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stooltool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stooltool)   

[Evaluation of a Smartphone Decision-Support Tool for Diarrheal Disease Management in a Resource-Limited Setting](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005290)

The Outbreak Responder is a decision-support and epidemiology platform for use during diarrheal disease outbreaks. There are two components. The first component is a rehydration calculator that automates World Health Organization guidelines for how to assess and rehydrate a patient with diarrheal disease. The design leverages geospatial mapping to identify critical actionable data. Outbreak Responder is designed for use in developing countries with high diarrheal disease burden. It was built by an international team of clinical and computer science experts led by Eric Nelson, MD., PhD at Stanford University.

### Geo4LibCamp
##### Role: Co-founder/Host
https://geo4libcamp.org/  
Geo4LibCamp is an annual unconference hosted at Stanford University. A three day unconference, followed by two working days to collaborate, learn, and make progress on spatial data services and support in libraries.

### iiif + Maps Community
##### Role: Co-founder/Co-Chair
https://iiif.io/community/groups/maps/  
This group works on defining best practice in associating geographical information with iiif materials. This includes iiif recipes but also more in depth work to align efforts to link iiif maps to geospatial systems. The group is creating a JSON schema suited to the needs of the IIIF community, including how to incorporate this connective schema with IIIF manifests.

### GISDay@Stanford

Stanford's annual celebration of all things location, including the cutting edge of geospatial technologies. Development, planning and coordination of the event, 3 years running. The schedules speak for themselves. Off-the-hook fun for geonerds.

### The Urban Resource Initiative New Haven Street Tree Survey

[https://uri.yale.edu/maps](https://uri.yale.edu/maps)  

A Continuing project to map the more than 30k street trees in The City of New Haven. Initial conceived as a field data collection exercise for the Urban segment of The Yale School of Forestry's 3-week graduate orientation, "MODS," this is an ongoing survey, now in it's 6th year. The project's core is an ArcSDE/MSSQL database of the 30k tree "locations" and more than 70k inventory records associated with them. As software platforms have evolved and suitable hardware has become ubiquitous, the project has gone from using a small suite of Trimble Juno units with ArcPad's "Check-in/Check-out" methods, to now creating feature services from ArcGIS for Server, through ArcGIS Online for Organizations, and be deployed for offline editing through Collector for ArcGIS on iOS and Android. The latest iteration of the project has made it possible for students to use their own equipment to survey, without incurring cellular data costs, and freeing the project from the cost of purchasing and maintaining equipment.

### Photogrammar
[photogrammar.yale.edu](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/)  

Yale University's first NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant [[HD-51421-11]](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51421-11)  

   "The Photogrammar Project is a Yale University Public Humanities Project designed to offer an interactive web-based open source visualization   platform for the one-hundred and sixty-thousand photographs created by the federal government from 1935 to 1943 under the Farm Securities Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI)."

  Working closely with other members of the Photogrammar Team, I have been responsible for the creation and management of the geospatial data for the project. This has included geocoding ninety-thousand images (~5000 unique locations) using various geocoding platforms and APIs. The bulk of the geocoding work was done using Tulane University's Geolocate API, through Google/OpenRefine. Work also included the attachment of location information to the existing collection metadata and association with historic county boundary data, using SQL, for visualization in the CartoDB platform.
