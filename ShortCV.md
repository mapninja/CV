## Selected Projects
### [Making Pastoralists Count](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0VBNW87ArI)

Funding: [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ](https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/geospatial-methodology-reach-mobile-populations)  

StoryMap (beta):
[https://arcg.is/0XGrDO](https://arcg.is/0XGrDO)

In one of its first grants, DGF released imagery to Stanford for analysis of health in nomadic pastoral populations in Ethiopia. Hannah Wild & SGC Team used the data to locate mobile settlements quickly enough to develop and deliver hundreds of surveys to people living in the remote region of Ethiopia’s Lower Omo Valley. Gates funding has expanded the project to include ML-based rapid settlement detection, using Planet.com daily imagery.

### [MotoMeds](https://nelson.research.pediatrics.med.ufl.edu/motomeds/)  


[Improving Nighttime Access to Care and Treatment (Part 2) (INACT2)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03943654)

Consulting spatial data scientist and field data specialist. Designed and implemented survey frameworks for highly-dispersed, unaddressed households in Les Cayes, Leogane and Gressier communes, Haiti.

### [Outbreak Responder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stooltool)  

[Evaluation of a Smartphone Decision-Support Tool for Diarrheal Disease Management in a Resource-Limited Setting](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005290)

The Outbreak Responder is a decision-support and epidemiology platform for use during diarrheal disease outbreaks. The first component is a rehydration calculator that automates World Health Organization guidelines for how to assess and rehydrate a patient with diarrheal disease. The second component is intended for the Outbreak Response Team that may include epidemiologists, public health administrators, and clinicians. The design leverages geospatial mapping to identify critical actionable data. 

### [Geo4LibCamp](https://geo4libcamp.org/)
##### Role: Co-founder/Host
 
Geo4LibCamp is an annual unconference hosted at Stanford University. A three day unconference, followed by two working days to collaborate, learn, and make progress on spatial data services and support in libraries.

### [iiif + Maps Community](https://iiif.io/community/groups/maps/)
##### Role: Co-founder/Co-Chair
  
This group works on developing extensions that enable, and defining best practice in, associating geographical information with [iiif image materials](https://iiif.io/). This includes iiif recipes but also more in depth work to align efforts to link iiif maps to geospatial systems. The group has produced two extension to the iiif imagery framework: [the navPlace extension](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/), which allows geographic data associated with digital objects and collections to be provided in a structured manner; and [the geoRef Extension](https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/), which allows digitized cartographic collections to be [placed in their geographic context](https://felt.com/map/Stanford-IIIF-Allmaps-org-GX3HHODYTMqFHNrecujuyD?loc=52.38274,-355.17262,12.92z).

### Photogrammar
[photogrammar.yale.edu](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/)  

Yale University's first NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant [[HD-51421-11]](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51421-11)  

   "The Photogrammar Project is a Yale University Public Humanities Project designed to offer an interactive web-based open source visualization   platform for the one-hundred and sixty-thousand photographs created by the federal government from 1935 to 1943 under the Farm Securities Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI)."
