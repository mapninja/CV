## Teaching   
### EARTHSYS 144: Fundamentals of Geographic Information Science (GIS) (ESS 164)  
Autumn Quarter 2020-present  

"Everything is somewhere, and that somewhere matters." The rapid growth and maturity of spatial data technologies over the past decade represent a paradigm shift in the applied use of location data from high-level overviews of administrative interests, to highly personalized location-based services that place the individual at the center of the map, at all times. The use of spatial data and related technology continues to grow in fields ranging from environmental sciences to epidemiology to market prediction. This course will present an overview of current approaches to the use of spatial data and its creation, capture, management, analysis and presentation, in a research context. Topics will include modeling of geographic objects and associated data, modeling of geographic space and the conceptual foundations of "spatial thinking," field data collection, basic spatial statistical analysis, remote sensing & the use of satellite-based imagery, "Big Data" and machine learning approaches to spatial data, and cartographic design and presentation including the use of web-based "Storymap" platforms.n nThe course will consist of weekly lectures, guest speakers, computer lab assignments and an individual final project requirement.

## Selected Projects
### Nomadic Pastoralist Settlement Survey

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0VBNW87ArI  

Currently funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:  
https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/geospatial-methodology-reach-mobile-populations

see: "Surveying Nomadic Health" [http://trajectorymagazine.com/digitalglobe-foundation-celebrates-10-years/](http://trajectorymagazine.com/digitalglobe-foundation-celebrates-10-years/)   

StoryMap (beta):
[https://arcg.is/0XGrDO](https://arcg.is/0XGrDO)


The Stanford Geospatial Center is now working with School of Medicine researcher, Hannah Binzen Wild, to incorporate lessons learned in the field and to automate the use of high-cadence satellite imagery, machine learning in identifying the locations of active nomadic pastoralist settlements. Remote in the extreme, widely dispersed and highly mobile, the difficulty of conducting complete settlement surveys has resulted in the Nyangatom, and populations like them, being missed by most public health needs assessments in the past. Wild's aim is to perform the first randomized surveys on these types of populations in order to provide baseline data for the evaluation of future public health interventions.

### Outbreak Responder  

The app:  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stooltool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stooltool)   

[Evaluation of a Smartphone Decision-Support Tool for Diarrheal Disease Management in a Resource-Limited Setting](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005290)

The Outbreak Responder is a decision-support and epidemiology platform for use during diarrheal disease outbreaks. There are two components. The first component is a rehydration calculator that automates World Health Organization guidelines for how to assess and rehydrate a patient with diarrheal disease. The calculator is designed to be used in 30 seconds and does not require an account or connectivity. The second component is intended for the Outbreak Response Team that may include epidemiologists, public health administrators, and clinicians. This component requires a login/password. Patients are organized in a registry with icons that designate disease severity. Each patient record contains basic demographic, clinical, laboratory, and geospatial data. All aspects of the platform are encrypted and secure to industry standard. Data are visualized on a secure dashboard that helps administrators optimize resource allocation during rapidly evolving outbreaks. The dashboard also helps clinicians improve the quality of care delivered at the bedside. The design leverages geospatial mapping to identify critical actionable data. Outbreak Responder is designed for use in developing countries with high diarrheal disease burden. It was built by an international team of clinical and computer science experts led by Eric Nelson, MD., PhD at Stanford University.

### The Urban Resource Initiative New Haven Street Tree Survey

[https://uri.yale.edu/maps](https://uri.yale.edu/maps)  

A Continuing project to map the more than 30k street trees in The City of New Haven. Initial conceived as a field data collection exercise for the Urban segment of The Yale School of Forestry's 3-week graduate orientation, "MODS," this is an ongoing survey, now in it's 6th year. The project's core is an ArcSDE/MSSQL database of the 30k tree "locations" and more than 70k inventory records associated with them. As software platforms have evolved and suitable hardware has become ubiquitous, the project has gone from using a small suite of Trimble Juno units with ArcPad's "Check-in/Check-out" methods, to now creating feature services from ArcGIS for Server, through ArcGIS Online for Organizations, and be deployed for offline editing through Collector for ArcGIS on iOS and Android. The latest iteration of the project has made it possible for students to use their own equipment to survey, without incurring cellular data costs, and freeing the project from the cost of purchasing and maintaining equipment.

### Photogrammar
[photogrammar.yale.edu](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/)  

Yale University's first NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant [[HD-51421-11]](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51421-11)  

   "The Photogrammar Project is a Yale University Public Humanities Project designed to offer an interactive web-based open source visualization   platform for the one-hundred and sixty-thousand photographs created by the federal government from 1935 to 1943 under the Farm Securities Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI)."

  Working closely with other members of the Photogrammar Team, I have been responsible for the creation and management of the geospatial data for the project. This has included geocoding ninety-thousand images (~5000 unique locations) using various geocoding platforms and APIs. The bulk of the geocoding work was done using Tulane University's Geolocate API, through Google/OpenRefine. Work also included the attachment of location information to the existing collection metadata and association with historic county boundary data, using SQL, for visualization in the CartoDB platform.
