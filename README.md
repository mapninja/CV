###Selected Projects 

####Outbreak Responder
The Outbreak Responder is a decision-support and epidemiology platform for use during diarrheal disease outbreaks. There are two components. The first component is a rehydration calculator that automates World Health Organization guidelines for how to assess and rehydrate a patient with diarrheal disease. The calculator is designed to be used in 30 seconds and does not require an account or connectivity. The second component is intended for the Outbreak Response Team that may include epidemiologists, public health administrators, and clinicians. This component requires a login/ password. Patients are organized in a registry with icons that designate disease severity. Each patient record contains basic demographic, clinical, laboratory, and geospatial data. All aspects of the platform are encrypted and secure to industry standard. Data are visualized on a secure dashboard that helps administrators optimize resource allocation during rapidly evolving outbreaks. The dashboard also helps clinicians improve the quality of care delivered at the bedside. The design leverages geospatial mapping to identify critical actionable data. Outbreak Responder is designed for use in developing countries with high diarrheal disease burden. It was built by an international team of clinical and computer science experts led by Eric Nelson MD PhD at Stanford University.


####The Urban Resource Initiative New Haven Street Tree Survey 
A Continuing project to map the more than 30k street trees in The City of New Haven. Initial conceived as a field data collection exercise for the Urban segment of The Yale School of Forestry's 3-week graduate orientation, "MODS," this is an ongoing survey, now in it's 6th year. The project's core is an ArcSDE/MSSQL database of the 30k tree "locations" and more than 70k inventory records associated with them. As software platforms have evolved and suitable hardware has become ubiquitous, the project has gone from using a small suite of Trimble Juno units with ArcPad's "Check-in/Check-out" methods, to now creating feature services from ArcGIS for Server, through ArcGIS Online for Organizations, and be deployed for offline editing through Collector for ArcGIS on iOS and Android. The latest iteration of the project has made it possible for students to use their own equipment to survey, without incurring cellular data costs, and freeing the project from the cost of purchasing and maintaining equipment.

####Photogrammar
[photogrammar.yale.edu](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/)  
Yale University's first NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant [[HD-51421-11]](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51421-11)  
   "The Photogrammar Project is a Yale University Public Humanities Project designed to offer an interactive web-based open source visualization   platform for the one-hundred and sixty thousand photographs created by the federal government from 1935 to 1943 under the Farm Securities Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI)." 
   
  Working closely with other members of the Photogrammar Team, I have been responsible for the creation and management of the geospatial data for the project. This has included geocoding ninety thousand images (~5000 unique locations) using various geocoding platforms and APIs. The bulk of the geocoding work was done using Tulane University's Geolocate API, through Google/OpenRefine. Work also included the attachment of location information to the existing collection metadata and association with historic county boundary data, using SQL, for visualization in the CartoDB platform. 

####Hilltop Cemetery Investigation
  Under the direction of Yale Law School professor, Richard Brooks, I led a non-invasive archaeological investigation of the historic Hilltop Cemetery at Chappaquidick Island, MA. In order to evaluate the  orientation of graves contemporaneous with that of Capt. William Martin, ground penetrating radar survey(GPR), kite aerial photography and total station survey were performed over the course of three days. I was responsible for all aspects of field data collection on the project, from operation and maintenance of GPR equipment to post-survey processing of all data, production of maps and and analysis of grave orientation.

####Digital Atlas of New Haven Application  
[Digital Atlas of New Haven](http://bit.ly/digitalnewhaven)  
  A pilot to test the utility and feasibility of a project to digitize, georeference, mosaic and make accessible the Yale Map Department's collection of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, and similar series. For the pilot, I took previously digitized images of the 1911 Atlas of New Haven, georeferenced, mosaicked and tilecached them using, primarily, Esri-based tools. I then published the map series as a tile service using Esri's ArcGIS Online for Organization's hosted service capabilities and JavaScript Map Application Templates. The application incorporated responsive design and can leverage GPS location on mobile devices for use in the field. The application is currently used by the University Librarian as a demonstration of innovative transformations of Library Collections for supporting research and teaching,
