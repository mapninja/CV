## Selected Projects
### Nomadic Pastoralist Settlement Survey

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0VBNW87ArI  

Currently funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:  
https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/geospatial-methodology-reach-mobile-populations

see: "Surveying Nomadic Health" [http://trajectorymagazine.com/digitalglobe-foundation-celebrates-10-years/](http://trajectorymagazine.com/digitalglobe-foundation-celebrates-10-years/)   

StoryMap (beta):
[https://arcg.is/0XGrDO](https://arcg.is/0XGrDO)


The Stanford Geospatial Center is now working with School of Medicine researcher, Hannah Binzen Wild, to incorporate lessons learned in the field and to automate the use of high-cadence satellite imagery, machine learning in identifying the locations of active nomadic pastoralist settlements. Remote in the extreme, widely dispersed and highly mobile, the difficulty of conducting complete settlement surveys has resulted in the Nyangatom, and populations like them, being missed by most public health needs assessments in the past. Wild's aim is to perform the first randomized surveys on these types of populations in order to provide baseline data for the evaluation of future public health interventions.

### MotoMeds  
https://nelson.research.pediatrics.med.ufl.edu/motomeds/

[Improving Nighttime Access to Care and Treatment (Part 2) (INACT2)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03943654)

Part of the Improving Nighttime Access to Care and Treatment (INACT) Project.

Consulting spatial data scientist and field data specialist. Designed and implemented survey frameworks for highly-dispersed, unaddressed households in Les Cayes, Leogane and Gressier communes, Haiti.

### Outbreak Responder  

The app:  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stooltool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stooltool)   

[Evaluation of a Smartphone Decision-Support Tool for Diarrheal Disease Management in a Resource-Limited Setting](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005290)

The Outbreak Responder is a decision-support and epidemiology platform for use during diarrheal disease outbreaks. There are two components. The first component is a rehydration calculator that automates World Health Organization guidelines for how to assess and rehydrate a patient with diarrheal disease. The calculator is designed to be used in 30 seconds and does not require an account or connectivity. The second component is intended for the Outbreak Response Team that may include epidemiologists, public health administrators, and clinicians. The design leverages geospatial mapping to identify critical actionable data. Outbreak Responder is designed for use in developing countries with high diarrheal disease burden. It was built by an international team of clinical and computer science experts led by Eric Nelson, MD., PhD at Stanford University.

### Geo4LibCamp
##### Role: Co-founder/Host
https://geo4libcamp.org/

### iiif + Maps Community
##### Role: Co-founder/Co-Chair
https://iiif.io/community/groups/maps/  
This group works on developing extensions that enable, and defining best practice in, associating geographical information with [iiif image materials](https://iiif.io/). This includes iiif recipes but also more in depth work to align efforts to link iiif maps to geospatial systems. The group has produced two extension to the iiif imagery framework: [the navPlace extension](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/), which allows geographic data associated with digital objects and collections to be provided in a structured manner; and [the geoRef Extension](https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/), which allows digitized cartographic collections to be [placed in their geographic context](https://felt.com/map/Stanford-IIIF-Allmaps-org-GX3HHODYTMqFHNrecujuyD?loc=52.38274,-355.17262,12.92z).
### GISDay@Stanford

### Photogrammar
[photogrammar.yale.edu](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/)  

Yale University's first NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant [[HD-51421-11]](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HD-51421-11)  

   "The Photogrammar Project is a Yale University Public Humanities Project designed to offer an interactive web-based open source visualization   platform for the one-hundred and sixty-thousand photographs created by the federal government from 1935 to 1943 under the Farm Securities Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI)."

  Working closely with other members of the Photogrammar Team, I have been responsible for the creation and management of the geospatial data for the project. This has included geocoding ninety-thousand images (~5000 unique locations) using various geocoding platforms and APIs. The bulk of the geocoding work was done using Tulane University's Geolocate API, through Google/OpenRefine. Work also included the attachment of location information to the existing collection metadata and association with historic county boundary data, using SQL, for visualization in the CartoDB platform.
